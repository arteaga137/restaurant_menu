Welcome to the first exercise of the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp! In this project, we have developed a menu webpage for a restaurant.

The goal of this exercise was to replicate and create a digital version of a restaurant's menu. We've utilized HTML and CSS to achieve a responsive and user-friendly design, making it accessible across various devices.
